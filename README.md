# AWS EC2 for Node.js: A Detailed Guide to Deployment, Environment Variables, and SSL Setup

- EC2 `(Elastic Compute Cloud)` is a service provided by Amazon AWS that allow users to rent virtual computers on which to run their own computer applications.
- EC2 instances can be configured with various operating systems, CPU, memory, storage, and networking capacities, providing a flexible and scalable computing environment.

### How to Deploy Node.js Application on AWS EC2:

1. **Launch an AWS EC2 instance:** An AWS EC2 instance is essentially a virtual server hosted in the cloud by Amazon Web Services (AWS). It provides the capability to deploy and run applications on AWS infrastructure without the need for physical hardware investments.
    
    First of all launch an  AWS EC2 instance:
    
    - Create an account on [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/) and then search the service EC2.
    - Then click on launch instance.

    - Enter a name for your server (e.g., test2-server) and select Ubuntu as the AMI (Amazon Machine Image), which contains the software configuration required to launch your instance.

        ---
        
        1. **Final Setup:**
        - **Update and Upgrade Linux machine and install node and NVM.**
        
        ```jsx
        sudo apt update
        ```
        
        ```jsx
        sudo apt upgrade
        ```
        
        - Install `git`.
        
        ```jsx
        sudo apt install -y git 
        ```
        
        - Install Node.
        
        ```jsx
        curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.1/install.sh | bash
        ```
        
        - Now, reload the bash configuration by executing the following command.
        
        ```jsx
        source ~/.bashrc
        ```
        
        - Install `npm`.
        
        ```jsx
        sudo apt install npm
        ```
        
        - Confirm the successful install of `npm` by running the following command:
        
        ```jsx
        npm --version
        ```
        
        - If you are getting your `npm` version on executing the above command, it means `npm` is installed successfully on your system.

        1. **Generate SSH Key and connect with GitHub** :
        - Execute the following command to generate a SSH key that will help to connect to your GitHub. Copy the generated SSH key and open your GitHub account.
        
        ```jsx
        ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your_email@example.com"
        ```
        
        - Copy the generated SSH key by running the following command.
        
        ```jsx
        cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
        
        ```
        
        - Output of above command will be something like this. Copy the generated SSH key (complete key).
        
        ```jsx

        ssh -T git@github.com
        ```
        
        - It will show something like this:
        
        ![Screenshot 2024-07-17 044503](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5b278713-1cfc-44bf-bbc5-82014067cb5f)
        
        - Now, copy the SSH key of the GitHub repo that you want to deploy.
        
        ![Screenshot 2024-07-17 044642](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c3e2a31a-a823-4976-b3b9-7e154ebce66b)
        
        - Now, in the terminal that is connected to your ec2 instance run the following command
        
        ```jsx
        git clone git@github.com:SATYAM1000/deploy-on-ec2.git
        // replace with your repo SSH key
        ```
        
        - After cloning the GitHub repo that you want to clone, navigate to that directory.
        
        ```jsx
        cd repository-name
        //In my case: cd deploy-on-ec2
        //replace with your directory name
        ```
        
        - Now, run the following commands.
        
        ```jsx
        npm install
        npm start
        ```
        
        - This will start running your application. If you are environment variables error then follow the below given steps to set environment variables.
        1. **Set Environment Variables Using Nano text editor:**
        - Inside your cloned repo, create a `.env` file by running following command. Nano is a simple text editor that is commonly available on Unix-like systems.
        
        ```jsx
        nano .env
        ```
        
        - Nano will open the `.env` file in the terminal window. Add your environment variables in the format `KEY=VALUE`, each on a new line. For example:
        
        ![Screenshot 2024-07-17 045901](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a445ab35-9655-41f1-84e6-45589cc90fb0)
        
        - Now, save and exit.
        
        <aside>
        ðŸ’¡
        
        1. To save the changes and exit Nano: Press `Ctrl + O` (to write Out).Press `Enter` to confirm the filename. Press `Ctrl + X` to exit Nano.
        </aside>
        
        ---
        
        1. **Setting the environment variables using Vim text editor (Choose any one Nano or Vim):**
        - Vim is another text editor available on most Unix-like systems. Hereâ€™s how you can create or edit a `.env` file using Vim:
        - If the `.env` file already exists, open it with Vim. If the file doesn't exist, Vim will create it when you save.
        
        ```jsx
        vim .env
        ```
        
        - Vim will open the `.env` file. Press `i` to enter insert mode and add your environment variables:
        
        ```jsx
        DATABASE_URL=mongodb://username:password@host:port/database
        PORT=3000
        ```
        
        - Save and exit:
            - Press `Esc` to exit insert mode (if you're still in it).
            - Type `:wq` and press `Enter` to write (save) and quit Vim.
        
        ---
        
        - To view Environment variables in terminal, write the following command:
        
        ```jsx
        cat .env
        ```
        
        ---
        
        1. **Install PM2:**
        - PM2 (Process Manager 2) is a production process manager for Node.js applications. It provides several features that help manage, monitor, and maintain Node.js applications in production environments.
        
        ```jsx
        sudo npm install pm2 -g
        ```
        
        - Start your application with PM2
        
        ```jsx
        pm2 start app.js
        //Replace app.js with the entry point of your application.
        
        ```
        
        - Save the PM2 process list and set it to restart on reboot:
        
        ```jsx
        pm2 save
        pm2 startup
        ```
        
        ---
        
        1. **Install Nginx web server For Reverse Proxy:**
        
        ```jsx
        sudo apt install nginx
        ```
        
        ```jsx
        sudo nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/default
        ```
        
        - This will open something like this. Clear it and paste the following commands by replacing your own domain name.
        
        ![Screenshot 2024-07-17 052951](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/95cc2c3d-92d1-418f-ac4f-fd51c5092952)
        
        - Paste following commands by replacing your custom domain name and port number.
        
        ```jsx
        server {
        listen 80;
        # listen 443 ssl http2;
        server_name test2.dokopi.com; // your domain

        proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
        proxy_set_header Connection "upgrade";
        }
        access_log /var/log/nginx/test2.dokopi.com.log; //your domain
        error_log /var/log/nginx/test2.dokopi.com.error.log; //your domain
        }
        ```
        
        - Test nginx configurations by running the following command:
        
        ```jsx
        sudo nginx -t
        ```
